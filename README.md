# Verifiable Python

[Original vPython](https://github.com/ANRGUSC/vPython) developed by Dr. Gowri Ramachandran (g.ramachandran@qut.edu.au)

[WhistleBlower: Towards A Decentralized and Open Platform for Spotting Fake News](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/209248/)

This version of vPython is a simplification by Tao Liu (t24.liu@connect.qut.edu.au) and was built for testing purposes.

# Installation Guide

```
git clone https://github.com/EsperLiu/vPython.git

cd ./vPython

./configure

make

sudo make install
```

This will install vPython as an instance of Python v3.9.7 - if Python3.9 is already installed, there will be a collision!
